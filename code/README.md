# ü¶ú Password Generator

A lightweight, local, and open-source password generator written in Python.  
It focuses on **privacy**, **simplicity**, and **security** ‚Äî all running locally on your machine without sending or storing any data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

1. **Random Password Generation:**  
   The program generates a random password using Python‚Äôs built-in `random` and `string` libraries.  
   It constructs the password from a predefined character set consisting of:
   - Uppercase and lowercase letters  
   - Digits  
   - Special symbols  

   The password length can be chosen by the user (between 8 and 50 characters).

2. **Matrix-Like Effect:**  
   During the password generation process, a ‚ÄúMatrix-style‚Äù scrolling effect is displayed for 10 seconds to make the experience more engaging.

3. **No Data Storage:**  
   The program **does not store or log any passwords**, ensuring that sensitive data is never retained anywhere.

4. **Decentralized Security:**  
   Passwords are generated **locally**, minimizing the risk of centralized data breaches.

5. **User-Centric Design:**  
   Security and privacy are prioritized throughout the design, keeping user data **fully private and secure**.
